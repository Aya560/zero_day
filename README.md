# ALX Program ( Vagrant Project )

This file is required by the task and also a mandatory file for my repo.

Let me tell you some facts about vagrant :

1- Vagrant is an open-source tool for building and managing virtual environments.
2- Vagrant allows developers to create consistent and reproducible development environments, which can be easily shared and replicated.
3- Vagrant uses a declarative configuration file called Vagrantfile to specify the details of the VM, such as the base image, networking, and provisioners.
4- Vagrant can be used with a wide range of operating systems and development tools, making it popular among developers working on different platforms.
